# üõí E-commerce API

This repository contains a fully functional e-commerce API, built from scratch with Python and the Flask framework. The project is designed to simulate a real-world online shopping system, demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of back-end web development principles, from initial setup to cloud deployment.

The core of the project is a **RESTful API** that exposes a series of endpoints to manage products, users, and shopping carts. Data persistence is handled by **Flask-SQLAlchemy**, using a SQLite database for simplicity in development and deployment.

### Key Features Implemented:
* **Complete Product Management:** CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for the product catalog, allowing administrators to manage inventory.
* **Authentication and Session System:** Routes for user registration, login, and logout, with protected endpoints that require authentication.
* **Dynamic Shopping Cart Management:** Functionalities to add, remove, and view items in an authenticated user's shopping cart.
* **Secure Checkout Process:** A route that simulates the completion of a purchase, clearing the user's cart upon conclusion.

The application is configured for production and has been deployed on the **AWS Elastic Beanstalk** platform, demonstrating the full software development lifecycle, from local conception to cloud availability.

## üóùÔ∏è How to Test the API

The API is deployed on AWS Elastic Beanstalk and can be publicly accessed via the following base URL:

**Base URL:** [http://ecommerce-api-dev.eba-tg62fziv.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com](http://ecommerce-api-dev.eba-tg62fziv.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com)

You can use a tool like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) to send requests to the endpoints listed below.
